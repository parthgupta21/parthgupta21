Hi, I am <Parth Gupta>.

I am passionate about learning and building things in software development. My interests include programming, problem solving, and exploring new technologies. I enjoy working on projects that help me improve my skills and understand how real systems are built.

My current tech stack includes:
• JavaScript  
• TypeScript  
• Node.js  
• Next.js  
• Tailwind CSS  

On this GitHub profile you will find my practice projects, experiments, and things I am currently learning. I am always trying to get better and I am open to collaboration, feedback, and new ideas.

Thank you for visiting my profile.
