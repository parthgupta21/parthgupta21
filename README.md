# 👋 Hi, I am Parth Gupta

## 🧭 About Me
I am passionate about learning and building things in software development. My interests include programming, problem solving, and exploring new technologies. I enjoy working on projects that help me improve my skills and understand how real systems are built.

I am continuously learning, experimenting, and building projects that reflect my growth as a developer. Collaboration and feedback help me progress, and I am always open to both.
